# ddlc_mod_1

waaaa will complete tomorrow as long as i dont forget

A few things I would like to improve on next time:
- Pacing. Next mod I'd like to do so without a time constraint, that way it can be as long, detailed, and thought out as I would like. 
- Writing more in character. I did attempt to write in Yuri's "voice" although tbf it's not really clear exactly what's going on inside her mind in canon DDLC. Perhaps this will come easier in a more lengthy and fleshed out mod.
- Incorporating other characters into the story. While I learned a lot while attempting to write from Yuri's perspective, I'd also like to learn how to write the other characters as well, such that I have a better understanding of the characters as a whole.
